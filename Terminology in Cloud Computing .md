## Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage, or network resources.
Its like creating number of instances of single physical server

## Virtual Machine
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. 
It allows running multiple  operating systems in a single physical server.

## API (Application Programming Interface)
API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.
Its programmatic way of accessing something 

**example**

Lets take Facebook or Instagram,
when we access that we can see the home page. that is Graphical user interface
You'll have many ways to access it, API is a application interface, we can access it programatically
Lets say someone wants 1000 virtual machines, it is tough to create one by one , so we will write a python script/shell script for that and you will get as many as virtual machines as requested.

## Regions
Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.

## Availability Zones
Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

## Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
Lets say everyone is watching IPL, at that time many people watch disney+hotstar and access that application, at that time requests for that server would increase and the server may get slow.
At that time Autoscaling comes into frame.
Scaling up or down based on requirement is called Autoscaling.

## Elasticity
Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.
Also known as Dynamic scaling or Autoscaling

## High Availability
High Availability (HA) ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.

## Fault Tolerance
Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.

## Disaster Recovery
Disaster Recovery involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.

## Load Balancing
Load Balancing is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
