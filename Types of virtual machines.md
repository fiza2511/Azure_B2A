## General Purpose VMs
**Example:** Standard_D2s_v3
- General-purpose VMs are well-balanced machines suitable for a variety of workloads. They offer a good balance of CPU-to-memory ratio and are suitable for development, testing, and small to medium-sized databases.

## Compute Optimized VMs
**Example:** Standard_F2s_v2
- Compute optimized VMs are designed for compute-intensive workloads that require high CPU power. They provide a high CPU-to-memory ratio, making them suitable for data analytics and computational tasks.

## Memory Optimized VMs
**Example:** Standard_E16s_v3
- Memory optimized VMs are tailored for memory-intensive applications. They provide a high memory-to-CPU ratio, making them suitable for databases, in-memory caching, and analytics.

## Storage Optimized VMs
**Example:** Standard_L8s_v2
- Storage optimized VMs are designed for workloads that require high storage throughput and I/O performance. They provide high local disk throughput, making them suitable for big data and large databases.

## GPU VMs
**Example:** Standard_NC6s_v3
- GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) VMs are equipped with powerful graphics processors, suitable for graphics-intensive applications and parallel processing tasks.

## High-Performance Compute VMs
**Example:** Standard_H16r
- High-Performance Compute VMs are designed for demanding, parallel processing and high-performance computing (HPC) applications.

## Burstable VMs
**Example:** B1s
- Burstable VMs provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline for a certain period. They are cost-effective for workloads with varying CPU usage.
