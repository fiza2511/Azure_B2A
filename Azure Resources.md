## Azure Resources
Azure resources are the building blocks of your cloud infrastructure in Microsoft Azure. These resources can be virtual machines, databases, storage accounts, or any other service offered by Azure. Each resource is a manageable item in Azure, and they are provisioned and managed individually.

- Virtual machine is a resource.
- You can create a resource.
- Outcome/ what u r creating here is called resources.

## Resource Groups in Azure
A Resource Group in Azure is a logical container for resources that share the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies. It helps you organize and manage related Azure resources efficiently. Resources within a group can be deployed, updated, and deleted together as a single management unit.

- Resource group means nothing but you can create any number of resources in that group.
- Lets say, example: Deployment group, only the deployment people who's virtual machines are under that group can access it.

## Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Overview
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the deployment and management service for Azure. It provides a consistent management layer that enables you to deploy resources with declarative templates. ARM templates describe the resources you need and their configurations, allowing you to deploy and update resources in a predictable manner.

The properties, you give while creating a virtual machine or any resource, those properties are given to ARM.
Resource manager,which creates a vm or any resource as required.

## Virtualization
In traditional computing, a single physical server runs a single operating system, and applications are installed directly on that OS. This approach has limitations, such as underutilization of hardware resources, difficulty in managing multiple servers, and lack of flexibility in scaling.

Virtualization addresses these challenges by introducing a layer of abstraction between the hardware and the operating system. It enables the creation of multiple virtual instances, each running its own operating system and applications, on a single physical server. This technology has become fundamental in modern data centers and cloud computing environments

- It is creating a multiple instances as required, from a single physical server.
- Generally Single physical server runs one OS.
- When u create these intanses, on a physical server we can say,running a number of Operating systems in a single physical server.
