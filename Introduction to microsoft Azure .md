**Soo before knowing what is azure its good to ask why azure is developed ?**

Lets take in the past like before 15-20 yrs maybe the companies or organisations used to have a data centres physically i.e in their organisations.
They used to have a server room and cables with high electricity power which is used to make, users access the application through that servers.
So these server rooms are called as data centers.
These used to be maintained and managed by the system administrators which was a tough job to do,soo this is called as a private cloud 
Managing the data centre internally in their own companies is called private cloud.
Here comes azure or any public cloud providers.
Here u can create a number of instances of a virtual space.
Lets take a virtual machine as as example
If it was in a private organization an employee or a developer asks for the server for his deployment,but we cant give the whole server to one developer
Here comes virtualization, creating a virtual machine, creating virtual version of something.

So now if its in a public cloud, a large physical server is logically split into many instatnces as required…i.e 1 vm i.e virtual machine is one server and it can be given to one developer.
Simply to reduce the manual work or reduce the wastage of resources, public cloud like azure is developed…

## Introduction to Azure
Microsoft Azure is Microsoft’s cloud computing platform and infrastructure designed to build, deploy, and manage applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

 It offers a wide range of services such as virtual machines, databases, AI, analytics, networking, DevOps tools, and Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities.
 
 **Key Point**
 
 Azure supports multiple programming languages, frameworks, and tools, making it a flexible platform for developers and enterprises alike.
